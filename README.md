## Collections (Doc/ Media)

Project media and collections live under the [Doc folder](https://github.com/soletswap/Ondog/tree/main/Doc). Use this structure to organize images:

```
Doc/
  ondog-logo.png        # Main logo (optional)
  ondog-hero.jpg        # Hero image (optional)
  images/
    collections/        # Each collection has its own subfolder
      space/
        space-01.jpg
        space-02.jpg
      city/
        city-01.png
```

Guidelines:
- Add more images by placing them into the relevant collection folder (e.g., `Doc/images/collections/space/`).
- Use the collection name as a prefix in filenames for consistency (e.g., `space-01.jpg`, `space-02.jpg`).
- Supported formats: `.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.gif/.webp`.

Usage examples:
- From README:
  ```markdown
  ![Ondog logo](./Doc/ondog-logo.png)
  ![Space 01](./Doc/images/collections/space/space-01.jpg)
  ```
- From an HTML page:
  ```html
  <img src="Doc/ondog-logo.png" alt="Ondog logo" />
  <img src="Doc/images/collections/space/space-01.jpg" alt="Space 01" />
  ```
