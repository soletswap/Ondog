## Adding Gallery Images via Issues

To add new images to the Ondog gallery:

1. Open a new Issue in this repository with a title starting with "Gallery: " (e.g., "Gallery: Ondog Space Adventure")
2. Add the "gallery" label to the issue
3. In the issue body, include your images using Markdown image syntax or HTML `<img>` tags
4. The images will automatically appear on the website gallery within 30 minutes (due to caching)

Example:
```markdown
![Ondog in space](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...)
```

or

```html
<img src="https://example.com/image.png" alt="Description">
```

Note: Only images from `user-images.githubusercontent.com` or standard HTTP(S) URLs will be displayed.
